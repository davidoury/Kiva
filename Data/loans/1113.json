Her husband is also employed. She has been farming for over ten years.\n\nShe learned about Milango through an employee, who invited her to the group. She joined the group, with an aim of accessing credit to better her business operations. The main challenge she faces is harsh climatic conditions.\n\nRebecca is applying for a loan of 46,230.86 Kenya shillings (KES). She will use the loan to buy fertilizers and seeds. She would also be interested in beekeeping, once her income rises. Her extra income from the loan will be added to her savings, to be used to expand the agricultural business.

Shabnam has a very difficult fate as her husband abandoned her and their 2 children.  Shabnam is divorced and raises the children alone.  She has a very hard time coping with family expenditures.  She decided to start her own business.  With this goal she turned to the course \"Get Ahead\" organized by the National Association of Business Women of Tajikistan and earned a certificate.  Now she can start her own business and become successful in this sphere.

Her primary income, however, comes from animal husbandry.  Nazira's son helps her with the animal husbandry business.  Additional income comes from her husband, who works in Russia and sends as much money as possible to the family every month.  Nazira wants to build a new house for her son, but the money she saved is not enough.  She learned about the Arvand organization from her friends and decided to make a request.  Nazira plans to use this loan to begin building the house and buy construction materials.

Maria wants to expand her food stall by buying tables and chairs, as what she earns isn't enough to be able to buy them. She will thus be able to have more clientele and have a bit more income. This is why she is asking for a loan, and to give her family what it needs without any limitations."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":400,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":263.49,"image":{"id":1345248,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Restaurant","sector":"Food","use":"to buy chairs and tables for her restaurant business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"SV","country":"El Salvador","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13.833333 -88.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":81,"posted_date":"2013-05-07T21:00:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-06T21:00:02Z","loan_amount":400,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Maria Ester","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":400,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":12,"loan_amount":400,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":33.48},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":36.21},{"due_date":"2013-08-11T07:00:00Z","amount":37.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-11T07:00:00Z","amount":38.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-11T07:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":42.09},{"due_date":"2013-12-11T08:00:00Z","amount":44.03},{"due_date":"2014-01-11T08:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2014-02-11T08:00:00Z","amount":47.42}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.48},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":36.21},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":37.26},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":38.81},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.69},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":42.09},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":44.03},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":45.66},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":47.42}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":33.48,"local_amount":33.48,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:08:11Z","rounded_local_amount":33.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373082826,"comment":null},{"amount":35.07,"local_amount":35.07,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-20T08:38:18Z","rounded_local_amount":35.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":382265645,"comment":null},{"amount":36.04,"local_amount":36.04,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-18T09:33:57Z","rounded_local_amount":36.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390740238,"comment":null},{"amount":37.69,"local_amount":37.69,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T09:06:39Z","rounded_local_amount":37.69,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399735837,"comment":null},{"amount":38.18,"local_amount":38.18,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-25T08:37:30Z","rounded_local_amount":38.18,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":411736922,"comment":null},{"amount":41.58,"local_amount":41.58,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T10:36:28Z","rounded_local_amount":41.58,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419769255,"comment":null},{"amount":41.45,"local_amount":41.45,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T09:45:21Z","rounded_local_amount":41.45,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430001717,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-08T22:46:03Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":556255,"name":"Edis Estela","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La Joven Edis de 29  a\u00f1os de edad, vive en su casa de habitaci\u00f3n ubicada en una aldea de San Lorenzo, Valle en la zona sur de Honduras, se dedica a la venta de tortillas, vende por encargo y sale a entregar las tortillas a sus vecinos que viven cerca de su casa.\nEdis es una persona muy trabajadora con ganas de superarse, est\u00e1 solicitando  el pr\u00e9stamo  para compra cargas de ma\u00edz y  le\u00f1a, porque que se las est\u00e1n dando a buen precio y quiere aprovechar esta oportunidad adem\u00e1s la demanda que tiene de clientes requiere comprarlo para as\u00ed tenerlo almacenado y no estar comprando por partes.   \nEdis su sue\u00f1o mejorar su casa de habitaci\u00f3n.\n\n\nSan Lorenzo, Honduras - Abril  del 2013.\n","en":"Edis, 29, lives in her house in a small town in San Lorenzo, Valle, in the southern part of Honduras.

She lives with her husband, six sons, and two daughters. Her husband is diabetic, so she always worries about his health. <p>\r\n\r\nFor five years, her husband has been running a wood shop, which is the only source of income for their family. All of her sons are very hardworking and help their father with his business. <p>\r\n\r\nParveen is a member of two-person group. She has requested a loan from Kiva's partner, BRAC Pakistan, to help her husband with his business. Specifically, she is seeking a loan so that her husband can purchase a wood-cutting machine and some wood-related materials such as wooden sheets, nails, glue, and chemicals for his shop. As they have no other source of income, with the help of this loan, her husband should be able to continue to operate his business, and with the profits he expects to generate, he would like to open a new shop for his son. <p>\r\n\r\nParveen dreams of providing her children with bright futures and prays for her husband's good health. She says that BRAC provides benefits in the field of micro-finance, and she is very thankful to BRAC and Kiva for helping

She is 55 years old, widowed, and has five children who are all now adults.  Priscila has always worked very hard to provide her children with everything they need to live a decent life and has supported them in their studies.  Her business is preparing and selling food.  In the past, she rented a spot in her local market but she didn't sell much.  For this reason, she decided to go out into the streets to sell her products.  There she found a lot of customers who were mainly local workers.\r\n\r\nPriscila works around 8 hours a day, traveling through different streets in the city.  The money from this loan is very important to her because it will enable her to buy the ingredients she needs to prepare her food.  In addition to her food business, Priscila also sews.  In the future, she would like to have a sewing workshop and give up the food business as it is very demanding.\r\n\r\nPriscila would like to thank those who will make her loan possible: both EDAPROSPO and Kiva lenders.  She thanks them for helping her community bank.\r\n\r\nIn the photo, Priscila is the lady who is sitting down and wearing a sky-blue, sleeveless blouse."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":4875,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":4875,"image":{"id":1340578,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy ingredients for her food business","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"Los Olivos","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-11.851111 -76.390556","type":"point"}},"partner_id":93,"posted_date":"2013-05-08T00:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-07T00:20:02Z","loan_amount":4875,"lender_count":35,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":" Priscila Del Carmen","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Mery Soledad","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Yanderith Singler","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Rommell Augusto Antoni","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true},{"first_name":" Delma Luz","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Delia Gloria","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":12700,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":4875,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3021.93},{"due_date":"2013-06-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3115.43},{"due_date":"2013-07-11T07:00:00Z","amount":3234.92},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":3327.72}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1159.99},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1195.89},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1241.75},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1277.37}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":1159.99,"local_amount":3021.93,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T10:08:09Z","rounded_local_amount":3031.05,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372916978,"comment":null},{"amount":1195.89,"local_amount":3115.43,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:04:10Z","rounded_local_amount":3124.83,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381694839,"comment":null},{"amount":1241.75,"local_amount":3234.92,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T11:01:33Z","rounded_local_amount":3244.68,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390557646,"comment":null},{"amount":1277.37,"local_amount":3327.72,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:52:06Z","rounded_local_amount":3337.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399806673,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-08T14:22:48Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T11:52:06Z","journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":556266,"name":"Jose Isamir","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"El se\u00f1or Jos\u00e9 tiene 28 a\u00f1os, vive en la zona sur de Honduras, junto con el vive   sus hijos y su esposa quien le apoya en su actividad comercial. su negocio es pulper\u00eda,  trabajo que realiza desde hace 4 a\u00f1os en su comunidad donde vive. \nDon Jos\u00e9 su negocio se encuentra en punto muy estrat\u00e9gico, porque esta por la calle panamericana y esto hace que sea muy visitado, tiene clientes con los cuales trabaja desde hace mucho tiempo brind\u00e1ndoles su producto. \nDon Jos\u00e9 el cr\u00e9dito lo necesita para la compra de ma\u00edz, frijoles, embutidos, carne de pollo, res, refrescos, arroz, az\u00facar etc. El impacto esperado con el cr\u00e9dito, es que su negocio crezca, ya que comprara  mucha m\u00e1s producto.\nDon Jos\u00e9 espera satisfacer las necesidades de cada uno de sus clientes los cuales los cuales le visitan a diario por la calidad de sus productos tiene mucha demanda.\nDon Jose sus planes a futuro es seguir creciendo en su negocio propio y generarse mejores ingresos para tener una mejor calidad de vida tanto para el y su familia.\n\n\n\nCholuteca, Honduras - Abril del 2013. \n","en":"Jos\u00e9 is 28 years old and lives in the southern area of Honduras.

Marcus notes that he does face certain challenges like pests \u2013 local leafcutter ants, birds, agouti \u2013 and diseases like black pod and monilia. Despite the difficulties Marcus is enthusiastic about slowly growing his cacao production. \n\nAs the sole bread winner of his home, Marcus works part time jobs, cultivating and selling other crops such has beans, corn, plantain and fresh vegetables, leaving little time for the management of his cacao farm. This Kiva loan will allow Marcus to hire the much-needed help to clean his farm and get it ready for transplanting new seedlings. Cacao farms in Belize are literally in the middle of the jungle, and require cleaning about three times a year. Cleaning is the process of removing underbrush to clear access to trees or prepare a plot for planting. \n\nMarcos\u2019 wife Luisa enjoys helping with harvesting and selling quality organic cacao to the buyers. The family puts a lot of importance on their children\u2019s education to ensure they have options when it comes time to stand on their own and provide for their own families. \n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":130.63,"image":{"id":1332972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To clean, prune and transplant Cacao","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"BZ","country":"Belize","town":"Medina Bank","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"17.25 -88.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":273,"posted_date":"2013-05-08T17:20:25Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-07T17:20:25Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":9,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Marcus","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"BZD","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":41.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.83},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.84},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":20.81}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":20.84,"local_amount":41.67,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-23T08:43:39Z","rounded_local_amount":42.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390993452,"comment":null},{"amount":41.77,"local_amount":83.55,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-22T08:47:58Z","rounded_local_amount":84.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":400255621,"comment":null},{"amount":26.3,"local_amount":52.61,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-29T08:35:50Z","rounded_local_amount":53.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410136461,"comment":null},{"amount":20.86,"local_amount":41.72,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:45:27Z","rounded_local_amount":42.13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419900677,"comment":null},{"amount":20.86,"local_amount":41.73,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2014-01-08T10:21:54Z","rounded_local_amount":42.14,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430088557,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-08T18:23:01Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":556543,"name":"3.9.281.08.thi\u1ec7u D\u01b0\u01a1ng Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. H\u1ea3i works in agriculture, farming poultry and\u00a0cattle.

He breeds cattle and he engages in producing and selling cheese and milk. He lives in the Batallas, a community whose inhabitants engage in agriculture and animal husbandry. This is Juan\u2019s first loan with our institution, and he will use it to buy a dairy cow. He wants to take advantage of this loan opportunity because he has not enough money to buy the cow, and this purchase will be of great benefit for him, as he will obtain more milk and will consequently succeed in producing more cheese and in having more milk to sell, thus improving his income. There are some challenges Juan has to face on a daily basis, such as buying fodder at a certain time of the year, and he will improve his cattle\u2019s condition thanks to the benefits from the loan.

This is a new concept. It's not been done here. We are taking an inside-out approach to beauty and well-being.\u201d\r\n\r\nLakita said she got the idea for her business from listening to her clients over the course of her 30 years of work as a licensed hair stylist. \u201cYou realize that people cover themselves up with cosmetics and make their hair pretty and drive fancy cars and buy these big houses, but there\u2019s a void.

That\u2019s where this was derived from \u2013 serving a deeper need.\u201d\r\n\r\nTo jump-start her business, Lakita received a loan from the Little Rock extension of ACCION Texas. She is using her working capital loan to build a website, from which she will host webinars on wellness topics. Additionally, she is buying inventory for the retail part of her business. She intends to sell all natural beauty products in her business.\r\n\r\nLakita said she learned about ACCION through her aunt, a business owner who advised her to go right to ACCION. \u201cI was looking for someone who helped start-up businesses, people who didn\u2019t have credit but needed start-up funding, and she told me to go to ACCION,\u201d she says. Without ACCION\u2019s help, Lakita says she would have been delayed in the start of her business. \u201cI would have continued working my full-time job until I could save the money,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s giving me a sense of security, knowing this money is helping me start and expand my business.\u201d\r\n\r\nOnce she launches her business, Lakita plans to contract with five beauty and wellness consultants. \u201cI\u2019m excited and nervous at the same time,\u201d she says. \u201cI believe this is a service that is needed.

The experience left her in a coma, and although she eventually recovered, she still suffers from permanent amnesia.  \n\nDespite her trauma, she has become a successful businesswoman whose work has touched people around the world, via online programming, public speaking and publishing.\n\nShe created Indian Creek Management LLC, under which she operates Darkness To Light Films, a movie and TV production company. She also is a professional speaker who shares her inspiring story at schools, universities, correctional facilities, law enforcement conferences and other venues. \n\nShe currently produces an online talk show, \"Living True and Truly Living: Real People ...

He is 50 years old and has been in a common-law relationship with Sra. Susana for many years.  They have a family that includes four children, all of whom are studying.  \r\n\r\nDon Bruno has a taxi that he offers as public transportation.  He started this business 10 years ago because he did not have a steady job.  There were many occasions in which his income was unpredictable, so he decided to provide public transportation services so that he could live without any financial worries.  Don Bruno says, \u201cWhen I started my business, it was very difficult because my first vehicle did not have license plates, so I always had to be careful to not get caught by the police.  They could confiscate my car since I had no papers to show them.\u201d   Nonetheless, his taxi was finally impounded and it took him three months to recover his vehicle.  He also had to pay a fine to the authorities.  \r\n\r\nThis situation led Don Bruno to form a group and seek support from a formal company.  The negotiations took four years before he finally received his concessions and license plates for his taxis.  Don Bruno currently has one taxi that he uses every day for his work, but he also has additional vehicles that he makes available for rent.  This time Sr. Bruno is requesting a loan so that he can buy tires and pay for the maintenance of his vehicle.  The loan will help him improve his services.
