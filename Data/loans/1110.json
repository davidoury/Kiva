Only the 18-year-old is still a student and dependent on her. She was born in Sauce, located in northern Nicaragua. In her free time, she likes to have fun with her family and cook a regional chicken stew. Sadly, she lacked the resources to go to college; therefore, she strives each day to offer her son a brighter future and professional training. \r\n\r\nShe wants to succeed and has been selling cosmetics and wood both as a street vendor and from her home. Previously, she made and sold tortillas. Her doctor advised her to give up this activity because she suffers rheumatism, and making tortillas required that she heat and wet her hands. She now works eight hours each day.\r\n\r\nShe will use the loan as working capital to stock her business. Mar\u00eda Susana thanks Kiva lenders for offering low-income people in countries like Nicaragua a chance for decent work.

Gerelsuren, 27 years old, lives with her husband and seven-year-old child in Darkhan, the second largest city of Mongolia. Since 2010, she has been working at the train station. Her husband has been working for National Emergency Agency of Mongolia for six consecutive years. Their son goes to secondary school. The family resides in their own house on a plot of land. Using her previous loan, she has purchased furniture and made her house a comfortable living place. Now she is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to purchase building materials such as planks, bricks, cements and metals. Using these materials, she wants to make an extension to her house and build a garage for her automobile. The house extension will stop the heat loss through the door and building a garage will protect their automobile from harsh winter storms. The automobile, which is frozen for long perciods during winter nights, tends to waste more fuel and release more carbon dioxide and chemicals harmful to clean air. So, making an extension and building a garage is essential for reducing fuel usage, emitting less smoke and then contributing to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is a very hardworking individual who strives for better future.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":181.11,"image":{"id":1342688,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing

She is married to Sulpicio, a seaman, and she is a mother to their children. She, together with her husband, manages their household while operating the business. At this time, she is working hard to continually provide income for their everyday expenses.\r\n\r\nElizabeth runs an \u201cukay-ukay\u201d business. \u201cUkay\u201d literally means to \u201cdig out\u201d or \u201chollow out\u201d from a stack or heap of anything. In Elizabeth's case, she is selling used (but not yet worn out) clothes that are usually stacked up on a table or mat. Some special kinds are displayed on hangers. In the Philippines, especially in urban poor communities, many people resort to buying used clothes from \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stalls. These are very much cheaper compared with brand new clothes sold in malls. Since her stall is located in an urban poor public market, her business flourishes. She earns a minimum of 300 Philippine Pesos (PHP) net sales every day. \r\n\r\nTo help her expand the business, she is requesting a PHP 8,000 loan to buy more used-but-quality clothes. Customers are attracted to buy from a \u201cukay-ukay\u201d stall with lots of clothes to choose from. She plans to add more pants or jeans, used bags and footwear. If she can roll the profits from this loan, she can meet the customers\u2019 demand. Through proper management of her capital and profit, she can expand her business and boost its income.\r\n\r\nElizabeth dreams that she will have a better living and hopes that her business will continue to be successful. She meets up with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business every week and draw strength and inspiration from the word of God she studies.\r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners \/ clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis. A fellowship group is composed of 15 to 30 community partners. The fellowship groups gather each week to study the Word of God, build social capital, and pay Micro Finance loans."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1342691,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Used Clothing","sector":"Clothing","use":"To pay for additional stock of used-but-quality clothes to sell","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PH","country":"Philippines","town":"Payatas-B, Commonwealth, Quezon City","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 122","type":"point"}},"partner_id":144,"posted_date":"2013-05-02T19:30:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-01T19:30:02Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Elizabeth","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PHP","disbursal_amount":8000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-08T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-15T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-22T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-05-29T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-05T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-19T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-26T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-17T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-24T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","amount":533.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":533.38}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.34},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":13.33}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T09:38:39Z","rounded_local_amount":2748.96,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372894880,"comment":null},{"amount":53.33,"local_amount":2132.97,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:39:50Z","rounded_local_amount":2198.52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381669919,"comment":null},{"amount":66.67,"local_amount":2667.03,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:29:45Z","rounded_local_amount":2748.99,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390534452,"comment":null},{"amount":13.33,"local_amount":533,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:52:38Z","rounded_local_amount":549.38,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399783850,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-02T20:10:59Z","paid_date":"2013-09-17T10:52:38Z","journal_totals":{"entries":2,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554812,"name":"Gina","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Gina is 44 years old and married with four children.

Filipino ingenuity, however, managed to see this vehicle as an opportunity to earn, and modified the Jeep into a 20-seater jeepney, open enough to provide adequate ventilation, sturdy for everyday travel, and cheap enough to buy and maintain.  They have become a ubiquitous symbol of Philippine culture. \r\n\r\nDolores previously received a 20,000 PHP loan that she used to buy spare parts and accessories and to maintain her jeepney. The earnings from her loan were a big help in her personal, household and business expenditures.\r\n\r\nDolores is requesting a 30,000 PHP loan to buy spare parts and maintain her jeepney. She will use the profits from her loan to help sustain her family\u2019s daily needs. She looks forward to this financial increase with gladness and thankfulness in her heart. In the future, Dolores dreams of having another jeepney. She meets up weekly with her co-fellowship* members to share stories of her life and business and to draw strength and inspiration from studying the Word of God. \r\n\r\n* All CCT community partners\/clients are organized into fellowship groups that meet on a weekly basis.

She is married and the mother of three children. Manzura is a teacher by profession. Since her childhood she dreamt of becoming a teacher and worked hard towards this. Her dream came true and currently she works as a teacher at a rural school. Manzura loves her work very much and she loves her pupils like her children. \r\n\r\nHer husband is in Russia as a migrant worker, and every month, when it is possible, he sends financial support to his family. Before her husband traveled to the Russian federation he worked with livestock breeding. Currently Manzura continues this business herself. Her paid salary is not sufficient and therefore she tries to develop the livestock business. When her husband left, he taught her this activity, and she easily handles the business. Her eldest son helps her with this. At home they have several heads of livestock. They live in a rural area and have a plot of land where the livestock can graze. \r\n\r\nManzura turned to the organization Arvand for a loan, in order to increase the number of livestock. She plans to purchase one bull calf for the loan, and hopes for help and support."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":225,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":225,"image":{"id":1337618,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to purchase a bull","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Jamoat Ismoil","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-03T05:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-02T05:10:01Z","loan_amount":225,"lender_count":4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Manzura","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-12T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":1000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":6,"loan_amount":225,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":237.64},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":245.7},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":254.03},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":262.63}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.47},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":55.28},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":57.16},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":59.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":53.47,"local_amount":237.64,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:17:28Z","rounded_local_amount":254.53,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372971495,"comment":null},{"amount":171.53,"local_amount":762.36,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T09:03:18Z","rounded_local_amount":816.54,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752019,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-03T05:33:56Z","paid_date":"2013-07-19T09:03:18Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554872,"name":"Kirinkai","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Kirinkai is a 51-year-old man.

He lives with his wife and child in a large traditional family in the Torakabougou neighborhood of the city of Bougouni.  Since he didn't go to school, he quickly got involved in income-generating activities, after spending a few years working as a shepherd alongside his father, in his village.\r\n\r\nHe then decided to buy and sell grocery products, a business he learned from his uncle.\r\n\r\nLooking for additional financial resources, Barou decided to join the loan program offered by Soro Yiriwaso.  This is his first loan, which he will use to buy five bags of sugar, six boxes of tea, eight boxes of cigarettes, eight boxes of soap, two boxes of powdered milk sachets and one box of candy.  He will resell all these goods in his shop.\r\n\r\nBarou stocks up in Bamako (capital city of the republic of Mali) and sometimes in Bougouni.  He buys his supplies from wholesalers and resells for cash and on credit to a retail customer base consisting of men and women.\r\n\r\nThanks to this loan, Barou is expecting to make a monthly profit of 45,000 CFA francs, which will be used to repay his loan and to contribute to his family's expenses.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":825,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":481.25,"image":{"id":1344030,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Retail","sector":"Retail","use":"to

is 51 years old. She lives in the small village of the Khelvachauri district with her son. \r\n\r\nEter has requested loans from local financial institutions several times for family business start-ups, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from the agricultural activities. In particular, they have 0.3 hectare plot of agricultural land, where different kinds of vegetables are grown. They sell the harvested products locally.  It is hardly enough to provide food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nEter requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Eter has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith this credit, Eter will renovate a two-room flat for renting. After the flat is renovated, Eter will rent it out and increase the income of her family. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

Amer now has an employee hired and has gained good fame in his neighborhood thanks to the good quality and competitive prices of his offered goods.\r\n\r\nAmer is requesting a youth loan of $2,100.

For this purpose, Zohra has requested a loan from Kiva\u2019s partner BRAC Pakistan, for the growth of her husband's general store. He would purchase items such as bread, eggs, detergent, tea, coffee, washing powder etc for his general store .This will help in increasing their monthly savings and improving their children's future as well.

She and her husband have been farming their land for seven years and are currently growing a good variety of crops, including maize, beans, sweet potatoes, cassava, and other vegetables. \r\n\r\nWhen asked if she was excited about starting to keep bees, Linet said that she was and that beekeeping is \"easy to manage\" and a \"good project.\" Linet plans to use the income generated from her hives to feed her family and to buy farming equipment, like jembes (hoes) and pangas (machetes). \r\n\r\nLinet's hope for the future is \"for me and my family to have a good life; that is, for my kids to have good jobs, enough food, and a good house.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":250,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":10,"image":{"id":1342989,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy beehives for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.283333 34.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-05-03T16:00:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-02T16:00:03Z","loan_amount":250,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Linet","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":20000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":250,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":20000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":250}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":10,"local_amount":800,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:26:39Z","rounded_local_amount":839,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381726162,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-03T18:11:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":555002,"name":"Anass","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Anass is 20 years old, a single man who lives in Taiz, Yemen.

lives outside of Kakamega town, in Kakamega county. Kakamega county is located in Western Kenya and is famous for having the only tropical rain forest in the country. Most farmers in Kakamega grow maize, but sugarcane, papaya, bananas and tea are also popular crops. The variety of crops grown in the region, as well as the abundance of vegetation in the old growth forest, make Kakamega particularly attractive for beekeeping. \r\n\r\nOscar is married, and has three children. His wife currently works as a teacher, while he farms their land. He has been farming for five years, and is currently growing sugar cane and vegetables. Oscar is excited to work with Honey Care Africa, because he enjoys the free training sessions and the chance to learn about beekeeping. He also likes beekeeping, because it is a long term project and is not time-consuming. \r\n\r\nThis is Oscar's first loan, and he plans to use the income from his beehives to pay school fees for his children and renovate his house. When asked about his hopes and dreams for the future, Oscar said that he wants to \"see my kids through university so that they can get good jobs.\"\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":300,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":12,"image":{"id":1342370,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy beehives for honey production.

Naseem is a 53-year-old married woman who has had a business of selling milk for the past five years.

She is a mother of two children and is very motivated to provide them a beautiful life with good education, food, and clothing. She has improved her business to meet the day-to-day expenses of life.  It\u2019s her first year with Kashf Foundation; she is happily running her business through the support of it. She applied for a loan of 20,000 PKR to purchase another cow.

He is looking forward to becoming a beekeeper because \"it is well paid, and the bees take care of themselves.\"\r\n\r\nThis is Harrison's first loan, and he plans to use the income generated from his hives to feed his family and pay his children's school fees. In the future, Harrison hopes to expand his land, so that his family has enough room to live on. \r\n\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":8,"image":{"id":1343010,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy beehives for honey production.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KE","country":"Kenya","town":"Kakamega","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"0.283333 34.75","type":"point"}},"partner_id":277,"posted_date":"2013-05-03T18:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-02T18:20:03Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":8,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Harrison","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KES","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":38,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-06-30T07:00:00Z","amount":15000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":8,"local_amount":600,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T10:26:40Z","rounded_local_amount":671.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381726173,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-03T20:49:55Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":555042,"name":"Vilma","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Vilma is 53 years old, married, and has seven children.

Thanks to her business she has brought her family forward, together with her daughter.  \r\n\r\nMrs. Carolina is a homemaker, an honorable and hard-working person who knows the value of being independent. Her work day starts when she gets up at three in the morning to make enchiladas and tacos, together with her oldest daughter who helps her. They have to be ready at eight in the morning, which is when she leaves her workplace to begin selling. Later, when she finishes her day at the market, Mrs. Carolina returns home to care for her younger children. She started the business with her own money. Her sales are in cash, and her clients are the people who pass by in the market. \r\n\r\nCurrently, she needs to repair her kitchen. The infrastructure has deteriorated as time passed. For this reason, she needs the loan to buy construction materials to repair her kitchen, which is her means of work because it is where she makes the daily food for her family as well as the tacos and enchiladas for her business.  \r\n\r\nShe is requesting the loan to buy sand, stone, white cement, and labor. In this way she will improve her family\u2019s living conditions.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":179.74,"image":{"id":1336450,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Food Production\/Sales","sector":"Food","use":"to buy sand, white cement, stone and labor.

lives outside of Kakamega town, in Kakamega county. Kakamega county is located in Western Kenya and is famous for having the only tropical rain forest in the country. Most farmers in Kakamega grow maize, but sugarcane, papaya, bananas and tea are also popular crops. The variety of crops grown in the region, as well as the abundance of vegetation in the old growth forest, make Kakamega particularly attractive for beekeeping. <p>\r\n\r\nAnne is married, and has three children. Both she and her husband have been farming for more than 20 years. Anne is currently tending dairy cows, raising poultry and growing vegetables on her land. She is excited to start beekeeping for two main reasons: the bees do all of the work, and she loves eating honey. <p>\r\n\r\nThis is Anne's first loan, and she plans to use the income generated by her beehives to buy even more hives.

The group is comprised of seven members and is governed by a Board of Directors and Isidora, their President.  The members of the communal association work in a variety of businesses including: alpaca wool spinning, selling sports jackets, selling knapsacks, sewing jackets, weaving textiles, selling meat-filled pastries, and weaving blankets. \r\n\r\nThe loan they take out will benefit these small-business owners including Isidora.

He lives in his house with his three children.  He's the one who watches over them because his wife died of cancer.\r\n\r\nHe has worked for more than ten years in construction and bricklaying.  He starts work early every day building houses of solid materials and supervising construction, because he hires his own staff to do this job.  He works every day of the week from very early until the afternoon because he works under contract and has to complete the jobs in a timely manner.\r\n\r\nThis is the second time this client has requested financing from CEPRODEL to finish buying construction materials such as sand, bricks, cement, etc.  This way he'll be able to construct his own house entirely of solid materials and give his children a decent home where they can live peacefully.\r\n\r\nHis dream is to leave his children a house because their future depends entirely on him: he doesn't have the presence and support of the mother of his children because she died of cancer.  He hopes that once the loan is granted by CEPRODEL he'll be able to fulfill his dream for his children.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":950,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":554.17,"image":{"id":1336535,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to buy sand, cement, rebar, bricks, etc.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Condega","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-05-03T23:00:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-02T23:00:01Z","loan_amount":950,"lender_count":34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Orlando Jose ","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-15T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":23500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":950,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2013-12-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2014-01-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2014-02-18T08:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2014-03-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.33},{"due_date":"2014-04-18T07:00:00Z","amount":1958.37}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":79.17}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-05-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-18T09:19:47Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373115711,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-06-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:42:34Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381675375,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-07-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:35:06Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390539652,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-08-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:02:13Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399788884,"comment":null},{"amount":79.16,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-09-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:36:05Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410065197,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-10-18T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:25:08Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419829074,"comment":null},{"amount":79.17,"local_amount":1958.33,"processed_date":"2013-11-18T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:44:51Z","rounded_local_amount":1973.25,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430384853,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-22T04:45:05Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554146,"name":"Francis Esther","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Francis, tiene 27 a\u00f1os de edad, est\u00e1 casada y tiene 2 hijos de 3 y 8 a\u00f1os de edad, con quienes vive en una aldea de Santa Cruz de Yojoa.

To provide the primary source of income for her family, she is involved in animal husbandry, having started this business 10 years ago with a sum of 5,000 som (KGS).  Thanks to Aigul's persistent work, today her business contains three cattle, and the monthly income amounts to about 10,000 som (KGS).  In order to further develop her business, Aigul requested a loan in the amount of 100,000 som (KGS) from the \"Bai-Tushum and Partners\" company to buy livestock for fattening up and resale.

Umedjon is a carpenter and has been involved in construction services for 10 years.  Umedjon's father is a doctor and works at a village hospital, and mother and wife have been involved in fattening up livestock at home for 4 years, specifically they buy, fatten up and sell livestock.  Umedjon plans to use this loan to repair his house because it is in a bad condition, and to expand the space for keeping livestock.

hard-working and admirable, and a typical Nicaraguan woman, who in spite of being a single mother has worked hard day after day to help her three children get ahead through her own efforts, without help from their father. \r\n\r\nTo earn her household's daily bread and to pay for her children's university studies, she works as a secretary for a State institution. She has exercised this profession for many years, and it has allowed her to ensure that her children do not lack for anything. \r\n\r\n[She says that] one of her great dreams is that God will permit her to see her children educated as professionals, so that they can be successful in the future. This will depend in great measure on the Kiva investors' financing a loan which she needs at this time, through Ceprodel, to pay the matriculation fees for the start of classes and the tuition for several months of the university, so that this will not be an obstacle for her son as he finishes his degree."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":202.06,"image":{"id":1338072,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Higher education costs","sector":"Education","use":"to pay for matriculation and university tuition.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"El Sauce","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 -85","type":"point"}},"partner_id":74,"posted_date":"2013-05-04T02:10:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-03T02:10:01Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":13,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Mar\u00eda Benita","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-16T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"NIO","disbursal_amount":15000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":18,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":505.39},{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":816.62},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":829.82},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":861.19},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":908.38},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":928.1},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":975.58},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1000.08},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1037.9},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1103.26},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1118.86},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1167.16},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1205.3},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1253.97},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":1288.39}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":21.06},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.02},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":34.58},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":35.88},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":37.85},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":38.67},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":40.65},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":41.67},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":43.25},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":45.97},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":46.62},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.63},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":50.22},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.25},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53.68}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":21.06,"local_amount":505.39,"processed_date":"2013-06-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:41:03Z","rounded_local_amount":524.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381675383,"comment":null},{"amount":34.02,"local_amount":816.62,"processed_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:32:38Z","rounded_local_amount":848.1,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390539660,"comment":null},{"amount":34.58,"local_amount":829.82,"processed_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T10:57:17Z","rounded_local_amount":861.81,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399788892,"comment":null},{"amount":35.88,"local_amount":861.19,"processed_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T11:30:13Z","rounded_local_amount":894.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410065205,"comment":null},{"amount":37.85,"local_amount":908.38,"processed_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T13:18:24Z","rounded_local_amount":943.4,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419829082,"comment":null},{"amount":38.67,"local_amount":928.1,"processed_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-21T09:39:38Z","rounded_local_amount":963.88,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430384861,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-04T07:20:38Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":555116,"name":"Nelly","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Nelly is 30 years old and lives in Paynesville, which is one of the populated areas in Montserrado County.
