emigrated from Guatemala to the United States in 1995 with his parents. He was 17 years old. Herbert worked for several supermarkets and grocery stores, but also went through several layoffs. \r\n\r\nAs the child of a family with a business background, Herbert always wanted to start his own business. He worked part-time in a gas station to put himself through truck driver training classes, hoping to start a transportation business. After graduation, he worked as a driver for someone else for six years to get the experience.  \r\n\r\nNow, Herbert wants to start his own trucking business to better raise his three children and care for his aging parents. He needs money for a down payment on a truck. He tried several banks, but because this is a start-up, he wasn\u2019t able to secure a loan. Eventually, he learned about PACE from a friend. With a $10,000 PACE Kiva loan, he will be able to make a down payment on a truck.  \r\n\r\nHerbert hopes his new venture will help him to put his three children into college and give his parents a better life to live.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":10000,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1509.98,"image":{"id":1347403,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Transportation","sector":"Transportation","use":"to

is a permanent resident of Rwenkuba of the Bushenyi district. He is married with 5 children and lives with 2 of his sisters' children, as she is unable to pay for their fees, so he is giving her a hand. He did not go far in his studies and hence started to fend for himself and the family when he was still young. Being pushed by the need to survive, he started banana farming on a small scale on his family's land that his parents allowed him to cultivate on. Because he is hard working, he has used his small savings to buy even more land where he is constructing a house.

The piece of land where he works is located on a hilltop, so he must ride his horse on steep roads in order to go to work.\r\n\r\nMauro is requesting a loan to Fundaci\u00f3n Campo to buy six bags of fertilizer, fifty pounds of corn seeds and other supplies needed to grow corn in a 14,000 m2 piece of land.

Zeinab has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith her credit, Zeinab will build a greenhouse.

Not different from his neighborhood, he also does rice cultivation on a 1.5 hectare area. He is able to earn up to 33,000 KHR (Cambodian riels) per day from the current business that he has been with for five years. \r\n\r\nBuntheourn, a seven-time borrower, formed a group of two with a second-time borrower in order to apply for a new loan with VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner). He has wisely utilized his past loans and has fully repaid them with success.

is a Ugandan citizen aged 45,he is married and has   six children all attending school. He is a business man basically dealing in cattle keeping and also runs a diary in the neighboring trading center. He has been in the business for the last 20 years and says his main aim is to boost his income and send his six children to school. He has purposely applied for this loan to buy dairy cows and buy veterinary drugs to treat local breeds.   \nHe hopes to use this facility to buy Freisian bulls for cross breeding for better yields. He will then be able to pay for further studies for his six children.\nDaudah confesses that his main challenge dealing with cattle and livestock is diseases like foot and mouth disease, as well as droughts that have run on for over eight months. However he is happy to have acquired six hectares of land which is now an extension of his grazing land. \nIn the photograph is Daudah at his homestead.

is 50 years old, married and has six children who attend school. He owns a cattle-fattening business. He gets additional income from his coffee plantation. He works eight hours every day. He started the cattle-fattening business in 2000 with the aim of earning a better living and taking good care of his family's many needs. He sells the animals at a profit after fattening them for a period of six to 12 months. His clients are different people from the neighborhood who buy the  animals for slaughter. His dream is to buy plots in the nearby trading center and build rental houses which will help him pay university fees for his children without any difficulty.He would like to use the loan proceeds for buying some calves for fattening. His main challenge is that sometimes animals overstay in the farm and when that happens, he loses money. Hillary is a very hardworking and committed gentleman who respects his loan repayment dates. He appreciates the services of the bank and he acknowledges that it is through its financial support that he is what he is now."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":775,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":452.08,"image":{"id":1342952,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Animal

In the beginning, Olga was afraid of starting her own business since everyone was talking about the financial crisis.  Now, she doesn't doesn't regret it and is glad she took that step.  She requires a loan of 5,000 hryvnia in order to replenish her inventory at her stall and to buy a new batch of children's socks, pants and shirts.  She plans to improve her business.  Not long ago, she found a better space at the market and hopes, with time, to move and begin selling there once she saves up the money."}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":364,"image":{"id":1348650,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to replenish goods at her store and buy a batch of children's socks, pants and shirts","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"UA","country":"Ukraine","town":"Khoost","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"49 32","type":"point"}},"partner_id":26,"posted_date":"2013-05-15T19:20:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-14T19:20:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Olga","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-11T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"UAH","disbursal_amount":5000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-13T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2013-06-10T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2013-07-10T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2013-08-09T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2013-09-10T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2013-10-10T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2013-11-11T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2013-12-10T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-01-10T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-02-10T08:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-03-10T07:00:00Z","amount":416},{"due_date":"2014-04-10T07:00:00Z","amount":424}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":53}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-20T09:05:32Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372947144,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-02T09:13:36Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381726695,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-27T08:40:52Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390589846,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-23T08:32:56Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399834218,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T14:29:40Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410109622,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T16:24:01Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419874499,"comment":null},{"amount":52,"local_amount":416,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T17:06:52Z","rounded_local_amount":421.72,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429523046,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-17T17:26:09Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":558452,"name":"Judith Gyadalupe","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"La clienta Judith vive en Guayaquil.

their combined skills and expertise, Bianca and her fianc\u00e9 created Wavvy Barber and Beauty Salon, a full-service, family-oriented barber shop and beauty salon that offers both the traditional services found in many chain hair salons, and a number of unique touches that help it stand apart from the San Antonio competition. These include spa services (manicures, pedicures, etc.) and hairstyles such as tapers, edge-ups and perms. \r\n\r\nAs the company\u2019s owner, Bianca established a firm mission to provide the highest quality services at affordable prices. Friendly and knowledgeable staff and an inviting environment are trademarks of the Wavvy brand. Bianca feels that these are the components that will keep her clients returning to the salon time and time again.\r\n\r\nIn the process of developing her business plan, financing was the one major roadblock Bianca encountered. But she didn\u2019t let that deter her. While doing research online about financing options, Bianca came across the Accion Texas Inc. website. She reached out to the lending staff and worked with them to qualify for a loan to launch her business. Now Bianca can purchase new equipment, as well as create a website to complement the social media components that are essential to her marketing strategy.\r\n\r\nBianca is thrilled to take the first step towards opening the Wavvy Barber and Beauty Salon. She has defined concrete goals that she would like her business to accomplish, including the addition of 10 full-time employees who will embrace the Wavvy mission and help it reach its revenue goals.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":5450,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1063.16,"image":{"id":1350039,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Beauty

Not to her surprise, she absolutely loved this role!\r\n\r\nShe eventually took her passion for event planning and launched her own business, Charisma Events & Consulting, in 2012, specializing in planning a wide variety of events from birthday parties to weddings to business expositions. Eventually finding her niche, Kadesha focused her business primarily on planning weddings.\r\n\r\nKnowing what it was like to plan her own wedding on a budget, Kadesha prides herself in helping clients plan their dream weddings on a personalized budget that works for them. Her core business philosophy has always been to treat customers as extended family, and she takes pride in the relationships she builds with her clients as well as with her vendors. Being a strong believer in marriage, Kadeha strives not only to plan great events, but to encourage all the couples she works with.\r\n\r\nAfter being in business for a little over two years, Kadesha is finally ready to take her business to the next level. She is going to use her $2,000 Kiva loan to move into her own office space and purchase an inventory of wedding dresses to sell and rent to the brides she works with. With this expansion, she hopes to truly become a one-stop-shop for wedding planning.\r\n\r\nWith her driven, go-getter attitude, Kadesha hopes to eventually open a local wedding boutique and grow her
