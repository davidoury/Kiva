Even at a young age she liked the field of healthcare and wanted to be a great doctor or nurse. When she finished school, she gave birth to her daughter and had to wait a year to study. For economic reasons, she was not able to study medicine, so studying to be a licensed practical nurse seemed like a good start. Time passed, and after her daughter reached 6 months of age Alejandra started to work because she needed to earn money to study. She started working at a bar and saved all the money she could. After a year of working, she searched on the internet for schools where she could study to be a licensed practical nurse. She had never heard of Campo Alto, but an old friend who had completed the same degree there found out that she was looking for schools and highly recommended Campo Alto. So, Alejandra went there to look around and ask about what she would need, and she liked it a lot. That was when she decided to start studying there.\r\nBefore she started she had to think about who would care for her daughter. Being a young mother, her parents have always supported her with her studies, but they weren't able to take care of her daughter. Alejandra enrolled her in daycare, and this took a lot of work. Once her daughter was settled, Alejandra started to study. She is now in her second semester and is very happy because she knows that her hard work will be rewarded one way or another. She has very much enjoyed studying at Campo Alto.

He lives in the company of his parents and two siblings, whom he takes care of in their own house. As the oldest son, he works to help his parents and siblings, saying, \"My parents are older and need my support.\" For this reason he has been working with the help of a partnership to rent rent a workshop for the creation of bricks. He makes 30 million bricks per month and sells them when he gets orders in advance. He now has repeat customers to whom he constantly offers good products. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, thanks to his effort, he has two bulls whom he cares for with dedication on his land. He also grows alfalfa to feed them. In this way he handles his long days of plowing the land. Now he wants to begin caring for cows because there is a demand for fresh milk, so he will take the first step by purchasing a good quality cow. This is his firm loan with Kiva and he feels happy to have encountered the help which he greatly needed to take on his objectives. Blidmer will invest the 500 soles in the purchase of materials to make bricks like clay, glue, and more. \r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":200,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":200,"image":{"id":1135546,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Bricks","sector":"Construction","use":"To buy materials to make bricks like clay, glue, and more.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"PE","country":"Peru","town":"HUANCAYO","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"-12.066667 -75.233333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":71,"posted_date":"2013-05-16T17:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-15T17:50:01Z","loan_amount":200,"lender_count":5,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Blidmer","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"PEN","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":200,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-03T07:00:00Z","amount":77.92},{"due_date":"2013-07-03T07:00:00Z","amount":78.88},{"due_date":"2013-08-03T07:00:00Z","amount":81.26},{"due_date":"2013-09-03T07:00:00Z","amount":84.22},{"due_date":"2013-10-03T07:00:00Z","amount":87.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-04T08:00:00Z","amount":90.22}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.17},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":31.55},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.5},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":33.69},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":35},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":36.09}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":31.17,"local_amount":77.92,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-18T09:22:40Z","rounded_local_amount":81.07,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381975604,"comment":null},{"amount":31.55,"local_amount":78.88,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-19T09:56:11Z","rounded_local_amount":82.06,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390996873,"comment":null},{"amount":32.5,"local_amount":81.26,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T15:26:53Z","rounded_local_amount":84.55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399864344,"comment":null},{"amount":33.69,"local_amount":84.22,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-18T09:06:01Z","rounded_local_amount":87.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410352716,"comment":null},{"amount":35,"local_amount":87.5,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:57:21Z","rounded_local_amount":91.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419904481,"comment":null},{"amount":36.09,"local_amount":90.22,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T11:01:11Z","rounded_local_amount":93.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430090534,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-16T21:59:15Z","paid_date":"2013-12-19T11:01:11Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559820,"name":"D\u00fao Donnis Group","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"D\u00fao DONNIS.\nLa se\u00f1ora Lucia de 53 a\u00f1os quien es la l\u00edder  de este d\u00fao, siendo una mujer comerciante desde ya m\u00e1s de 12  a\u00f1os,  do\u00f1a Lucia quien en su domicilio  cuenta con una venta de tortillas en las que atiende a muchas personas que la visitan  en los dos tiempos (almuerzo y cena) gracias a la atenci\u00f3n y el  buen servicio do\u00f1a Lucia logra realizar varias entregas a comedores de la localidad grandes  pedidos de tortillas, esto la ha llevado a contar con la ayuda de 3 se\u00f1oritas quienes le ayudan a elaborar las tortillas y atender el negocio,ella esta solicitando este credito para la compra de maiz para la elaboracion de tortillas para la venta.\n","en":"In D\u00fao Donnia group, Lucia is 53 years old and is the leader of this group, being an entrepreneurial woman for more than twelve years.

Aside from this primary source of income, her husband also helps earn extra income via a business selling ice cream. \r\n\r\nSany has been doing this kind of farming work for about 20 years. She is a third-time borrower from VisionFund (Kiva\u2019s partner) and she has fully repaid back her past loans already. She now feels empowered that she can sustain her business as well as her lifestyle. \r\n\r\nWith this new loan, Sany and her group members are seeking 1,200,000 KHR each. As the leader, Sany will use her loan portion to buy a decent motorbike to support her husband's business. She hopes that she can make more income to expand her ice-cream selling business as well as her crop-farming business on a bigger

Frustrated, the 35-year-old wanted to start over with a new career.  Searching for a new business idea, Carlos found apps and it felt like home. \n\nMyriad Co. began in June 2011, developing cell phone applications. One product, Fishing for Words, is an app inspired by Carlos\u2019 love for fishing.  He even has professional fisherman Bill Dance sponsoring the project to promote awareness.  The app is similar to the well-known game, Words with Friends, but with a twist.  The major difference will be that Fishing for Words will have a dictionary to define words, a rating system, 15- and 30-minute game timers for those looking for a short game and it can be played in Spanish, Japanese and French.\n\nWorking in his hometown of Memphis, Tenn., Carlos already has an app on the market, an automatic-reply app for Android called Autovoxt. Carlos says he wanted a job where he could relax and still get paid, and once he saw the demand for apps, \u201cI saw the vision and I studied the market.\u201d \n\n\u201cNo one taught me. The Internet and Google are your best tools,\u201d he says.  However, a background in computers helped. Carlos works as an IT administrator at a hospital where his coworkers are familiar with his side job. One co-worker advised him to visit Service Corps of Retired Executives (SCORE), a local free confidential counseling nonprofit organization for start-up businesses seeking advice, in Memphis, for financial support. \n\nThey referred him to Accion Texas Inc.  He used the Accion loan to finish the Fishing for Words app process, but mainly to create business cards and posters that have the app logo and instructions on how to download it. \n\n\u201cMy goal is to get 10,000 downloads the first week,\u201d he says. \n\nHis long-term goals are to hire those he contracts with in United States, Japan and India. \u201cWe have plans, if this expands, then these people will come under my umbrella. They\u2019ll move to Memphis and be my employees.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat separates the market is what separates Apple from PC. I have lots of ideas for apps. I compare myself to Myspace and Facebook.

He has good clientele because he knows how to win the trust of his customers. He offers quality products at a good price.

She is single and has a four-year old daughter.  Mercedes' business is a small grocery store that she has been running out of her home for seven years.  She has been a member of the communal bank for four years, during which time she has shown herself to be reliable with her repayments.  She has had eight loans thus far.

Her business gradually started to bear fruit and, although she now has a market stall, she needs to extend to other markets so as to increase her sales, make savings and eventually have a new and bigger shop of her own.  Celia sells her goods for cash or credit 7 days a week from 8am to 5pm and collects the money owed to her on a weekly basis.  She uses this money to make cash purchases in the town centre, where she qualifies for special volume discounts.  This would be far more effective if she had more money to invest.  It is for that very reason that she is applying to the Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for her first Kiva loan.  She will use it to buy clothing, footwear and other items for women, increase her purchasing power, offer a wider range of goods and, as a result, boost her income.

She has a sewing business there, and has 32 years\u2019 experience with this line of work. After training to be a seamstress, she tried working in small factories, and then finally in 2006 she opened her own business. Yunis obtained business experience from working in a pharmacy where she was in contact with many people who later became her customers.\r\n\r\nNowadays she has a workshop located in her own home which she acquired when her friend became ill. Her friend could no longer run the workshop so sold it to Yunis.\r\n\r\nCurrently Yunis sells both for cash and on account. Her main customers are businesspeople who sell clothing, neighbours, and friends who know the quality of her work and always use her services. She works from 6 in the morning to 8 at night to complete everyone\u2019s orders.\r\n\r\nHer greatest goal is to expand her workshop so that she can help her son get ahead. This is also her greatest challenge. Yunis is now seeking a loan from Kiva, the first time she has approached the Mario Santo Domingo Foundation. With the money she plans to buy fabric, thread and other sewing necessities. She will be able to increase production and lower costs through buying in volume, just what the loans are intended to achieve.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1100,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":394.96,"image":{"id":1352095,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Sewing","sector":"Services","use":"buy fabric, thread and other sewing necessities","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"CO","country":"Colombia","town":"Barranquilla","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"4 -72","type":"point"}},"partner_id":154,"posted_date":"2013-05-17T13:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-16T13:40:01Z","loan_amount":1100,"lender_count":40,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Yunis","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-07T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"COP","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":17,"loan_amount":1100,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":112892},{"due_date":"2013-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":115526},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":118222},{"due_date":"2013-09-07T07:00:00Z","amount":120981},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":123803},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":126692},{"due_date":"2013-12-07T08:00:00Z","amount":129648},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":132673},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":135769},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":138937},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":142179},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":145497},{"due_date":"2014-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":148891},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":152366},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":155924}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.09},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":63.54},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.02},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.54},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":68.09},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":69.68},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":71.31},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.97},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":74.67},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":76.42},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.2},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":80.02},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":81.89},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":83.8},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.76}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":62.09,"local_amount":112892,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-19T08:50:16Z","rounded_local_amount":113902.63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381705964,"comment":null},{"amount":63.54,"local_amount":115526,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-30T08:39:54Z","rounded_local_amount":116560.2,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390968252,"comment":null},{"amount":65.02,"local_amount":118222,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-27T08:24:13Z","rounded_local_amount":119280.34,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399817435,"comment":null},{"amount":66.54,"local_amount":120981,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-02T09:12:28Z","rounded_local_amount":122064.04,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410323709,"comment":null},{"amount":68.09,"local_amount":123803,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-21T09:52:28Z","rounded_local_amount":124911.31,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420082942,"comment":null},{"amount":69.68,"local_amount":126692,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-19T10:30:41Z","rounded_local_amount":127826.16,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":430062300,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-18T02:41:23Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559362,"name":"Asiya's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Asiya is a 45-year-old woman.

She runs a tea shop and also weaves traditional attire. \r\n\r\nLeishembi's main business is weaving and her woven products are women's wrap-around skirts and traditional shawls. She was making a good profit but her sales entirely depend on the festive season. She makes good sales during marriages, send-offs and other events and sales goes down once it is off season. So she also started running the tea shop in the front yard of her house. \r\n\r\nThe tea shop is near the main lane in the neighbourhood, which adds an advantage for her business. The tea shop is a popular place for all age groups in the neighbourhood. She is jolly and also a very good chef. Elders, women and children love the foods Leishembi prepares. People swarm in the tea shop especially in the morning and at noon time. \r\n\r\nShe serves Puri, chow-mein, smash potato fry and toast. Many school-going children depend on her tea shop for breakfast and she works hard to prepare so the children can eat their breakfasts and be on time for class. Besides running the tea shop, she also weaves at night and also gets finished woven products from other weavers and supplies them for profit to the women vendors at the main market. With both the businesses in hand, Leishembi now has a daily income as well as seasonal income, which enables her to make savings.\r\n \r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase sacks of flour and wheat and a full tin of edible oils for her tea shop. With the profits she will order woven products from other weavers and sell them for profits. Her growth in financial stability since the inception in the group has been huge and beneficial says Leishembi. She has managed to open a bank account and also send her children to private schools for better educational quality. She thanks Kiva and WSDS for the impending financial assistance and support towards the group.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are also engaged in weaving and tailoring.\r\n\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1375,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1347824,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Cafe","sector":"Food","use":"To purchase sacks of flour and wheat, a tin of edible oils and necessary supplies for her tea shop.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Imphal East","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-17T13:50:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-16T13:50:02Z","loan_amount":1375,"lender_count":50,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"A.leishembi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"A.inaobi ","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Maloti","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Y.punimashi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"N.shantibala","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-27T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":75000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1375,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-27T07:00:00Z","amount":75000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1375}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-17T18:01:52Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559365,"name":"Rufat","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Rufat is 60 years old, married, and has three adult children.

is a 34-year-old married woman. She lives in Tulkarem in a small house with her husband. Su'ad's husband is a worker with low wages, which barely cover the family's needs.

Since her husband passed away, she takes care of her three children. She takes both the father's and mother's roles and shows strong character.\r\n\r\nShe has continued extensive aquaculture, which she and her husband used to do. She uses the pond that was dug by her husband and his friends and then raises fish in the pond, which is located just across the house. \r\n\r\nManaging the family expenses with the retirement monthly pension of her husband was difficult. In order to supplement the family income, she joined the group and availed loan.  \r\n\r\nShe bought hundreds of fry and twats with her first loan. She also bought feed from the markets called powdered-husk. Since it is an extensive aquaculture, she entirely depends on the natural vegetation of the pond. She usually feeds the powdered husk in smaller quantities at a consistent time. She usually sells the fish to women vendors in the town market when they are full grown. \r\n\r\nShe says there was a time when all the fish died from an unknown cause. She was disappointed, but her love for fish farming urged her to continue raising fish. She says it is multipurpose because she loves raising fish and at the same time it generates income. She uses the profit for her children's education and the rest is used for household maintenance. She also managed to join the group's savings and she is happy to be part of the Sahei Group.\r\n\r\nShe says that neighbours' children and poultry get inside the house perimeter and play in the fish pond. She says it is sometimes rude to chase or chide the children and that eventually creates enmity between neighbours.\r\n \r\nWith the Kiva loan, she will purchase fencing nets for the fish pond. If she can arrange a proper fencing for the fish pond, then she won\u2019t have to worry about the fish in the pond. She says thank you to Kiva and WSDS for the support and says please continue helping us.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the group members are engaged in weaving, cattle rearing, ginger farming, vegetable selling and a paan shop. The group members encourage one another and support each other in their businesses and also conduct meeting on the second Sunday of every month.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1475,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1348789,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To purchase fencing nets to keep neighbours' poultry away from the fish pond.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"IN","country":"India","town":"Saikul","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"20 77","type":"point"}},"partner_id":238,"posted_date":"2013-05-17T14:10:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-16T14:10:02Z","loan_amount":1475,"lender_count":55,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Lhaineikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nemvah","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Hatneikim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chinkim","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimboi","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Jangkhonei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Kimjaneng","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Nengnei","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-05-20T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"INR","disbursal_amount":80000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":43,"loan_amount":1475,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":80000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2016-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":1475}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-17T19:16:10Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559384,"name":"Patrick","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Patrick is 23 years old and runs a bakery business in Tala town.

According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. <p>\r\n\r\nIlia's request for a  loan from Credo to start a family business has been approved within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. <p>\r\n\r\nWith his credit Ilia will purchase a milking cow and a pig as he plans to resettle in the Khasuri district and start a husbandry business.

In April, 9 years ago, he set up his own business, having been encouraged to do so by his mother-in-law, who has always been a shopkeeper. She passed on her knowledge to her young daughter who then helped her mother in the business.  When they got married, Luis' wife decided to start selling clothing and underwear, small electrical appliances and footwear, for which there had been a previous demand among her customers.  Their business gradually grew and so Luis used what he had saved from his redundancy pay to expand the business, in which his wife still serves the customers, while he works as an employee so as to generate two incomes and increase his family's wellbeing.  They sell goods for cash and on credit and make purchases in cash in the city of Barranquilla, where the warehouses and distributors offer them the best prices.  Today Luis' great ambition is to see the family business grow even more and that is why he is applying to Fundaci\u00f3n Mario Santo Domingo for his first Kiva loan, which he will use to buy sets of cookware, small electrical appliances, household goods, clothing and footwear, because sales of these goods are increasing as Mothers' Day approaches.  Luis and his wife want to be ready to rotate their stock for Mothers' Day and that is precisely why their Kiva loan will prove to be a succesful investment.

Betty assembles metal doors, windows and stairs. This work makes a good income because the city is starting to grow and there are more construction projects that need metal carpentry services.\r\nEvery time, requests are made from work sites further away from their home. Because of this, they just bought a mototaxi to transport their work tools, which include a soldering machine, an iron cutter, and other items. Betty likes her work because she loves what she does. It is going very well for her because their clientele keeps growing, and this means that they keep making a greater income. In the future, she hopes to open her own workshop and thus increase her income and provide work opportunities for other people. This will be her sixth loan on Kiva and she is very grateful for the economic opportunity.

She invested her previous loan in the purchase of manure, insecticides, fungicides, and payment for the labourers for the cultivation of sweet pepper. \r\nShe will invest this new loan in the purchase of fertilizers, manure, and pesticides, and to pay the labourers. She will cultivate nearly one acre of sweet peppers. Her husband and children support her in this. \r\nWith her income, she hopes to improve her home, buy milking cows, and to keep cultivating vegetables: tomatoes and sweet peppers.\r\nHer next step after repaying her loan will be to plant beans and sweet pepper in order to diversify her income."}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":625,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":625,"image":{"id":1352356,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Agriculture","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy fertilizer, manure, pesticides, and to pay the labourers.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"NI","country":"Nicaragua","town":"Esteli","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"13.166667 -86.333333","type":"point"}},"partner_id":176,"posted_date":"2013-05-18T00:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-17T00:40:02Z","loan_amount":625,"lender_count":23,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":false,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Esperanza Del Soc0Rro \t\t\t","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-22T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"USD","disbursal_amount":612.5,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":8,"loan_amount":625,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-10-20T07:00:00Z","amount":612.5}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":625}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"none","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":210.44,"local_amount":206.23,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T17:51:48Z","rounded_local_amount":210.44,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":419901474,"comment":null},{"amount":414.56,"local_amount":406.27,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T19:17:46Z","rounded_local_amount":414.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429550851,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-18T11:34:14Z","paid_date":"2013-12-17T19:17:46Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":559531,"name":"Ekua","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Ekua is married to a bag maker.
