","en":"Safargul is a 48-year-old resident of Kulob and a married mother of six. She has three daughters and three sons. Her husband works abroad. Safargul's oldest daughter helps her mother with work and is learning to embroider. Two of Safargul's sons sell DVDs and SIM cards. Her other three children are in high school. \r\n\r\nFor 15 years Safargul has sewn and sold national dresses (chakan) and skullcaps. This craft has been passed down from generation to generation. Safargul learned to embroider from her mother. Now this craft is her profession and she is teaching her own daughter. \r\n\r\nSafargul is requesting a loan to purchase an electric sewing machine in order to make her sewing easier and to save time. This will give her more free time to embroider skullcaps, which are sewn by hand.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":800,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":184.7,"image":{"id":1342268,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Embroidery","sector":"Arts","use":"to

","en":"Norida is a kind, cheerful, and helpful 42-year-old woman. She is married and has three wonderful children. Financial difficulties in her family prevented Norida from attending university after finishing high school. However, she completed a trade school for sewing. Since then she has worked as a seamstress from her home. She also teaches her daughters. \r\n\r\nAlthough this job brings her a steady income, Norida also works on a dekhan farm. Her husband also used to work with her on a dekhan farm, but the income was not enough to provide for their family comfortably. Hence, he decided to go to work in Russia just as many men from their village do. In Russia, he receives a regular salary that he sends to his wife. Norida's oldest son also works for the family. He is a carpenter, but his work is seasonal and therefore he does not always have an income. \r\n\r\nNorida and her family live in an old house that was passed down to her by her parents. Every year the condition of the house worsens. The weather, especially frequent rain and snow, effects the condition of the house. The roof is in need of a major renovation. All of the members of Norida's family tried to save money for a home renovation, but they simply could not manage to gather the necessary funds.

Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n \r\nThe main source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities.

The family's additional income is Irina\u2019s mother in-law's monthly pension.\r\n  \r\nIrina requested a loan from Credo to start a family business. Irina has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions for rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her credit, Irina will purchase car-painting equipment. She already has built a small commercial space where she plans to open a new business and paint the cars. Irina and her husband will work on this business themselves. They will not have to pay a salary to somebody else. This will decrease the expenses and increase the family profit. The new business initiative, financed with the Kiva start-up loan, will significantly improve the living conditions of the family.

is 53 years old. He lives in the village of Gora, Vani District, with his retired brother and sister and nephew. Pridon has requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up without any success. His loan requests are rejected all the time because of his low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\n\r\nThe main source of income for this family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have two milk cows, a vineyard and a plot of land where nut trees and vegetables are grown. The cows are milked every day to make dairy products. Harvested vegetables and grapes are sold with the dairy products locally at the markets and the family earns a small monthly income.\r\n\r\nPridon requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Pridon has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credit with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income.\r\n\r\nWith his credit, Pridon will purchase all the needed materials to build a greenhouse. With the greenhouse, he will be able to sell vegetables not only in summer but wintertime too. This will significantly increase the family income. With the increased income, Pridon will be able to expand his agricultural business and improve the family's living

is 42 years old. He lives in a small village of Gori District with his wife and three children. Ioseb requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe only source of the income for the family is from agricultural activities. In particular, they have a plot of agricultural land where maize is grown. They sell harvested produce locally. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIoseb requested loan from Credo to start up a family business. Ioseb has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

is 22 years old. He lives in Anaga village, Sighnagi district with his retired grandparents. Vano requested loans from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. His loan request was rejected because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions.\r\nVano is a professional car painter. He is working on private orders and earns a small salary. The family receives additional income from Vano\u2019s grandparent\u2019s monthly pensions.\r\nVano requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Vano has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provisions of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. With his credit Vano will purchase four piglets.

His loan request was rejected all the time, because of low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nGuram\u2019s wife is working abroad and she sends transfers to the family. His daughter Ekaterine is an administrator in a food production company in the capital city. Guram\u2019s son Ivane is an invalid and he gets monthly pension from the government. As Ivane needs special care, family monthly income is rarely enough to cover their food expenses.\r\n\r\nGuram requested a loan from Credo to re-start up the family business. Guram has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Guram will purchase liquid gas.

is 28 years old. She lives in a small village of Mtskheta District with husband Kakhaber and two children who go to school. Ia requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and her family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family is involved in agricultural activities. They have a plot of land where different kinds of vegetables are grown for selling. It is hardly enough for food for the family. According to Credo estimations the family belongs to the subsistence poor category. \r\n\r\nIa requested a loan from Credo to start up a family business. Ia has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith her loan Ia will pay for installation of electricity cables in their car workshop.

She lives in Matani village, Akhmeta district with her 25-year-old son, David. Asmat requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, but without any success. Her loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of the income for the family is David\u2019s salary. He is working at the local mail office and earns a small monthly salary.  \r\n\r\nAsmat requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Asmat has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.

is 62 years old.

His loan requests are rejected all the time because of his low income and his family\u2019s poor living conditions. The only source of income for Bakar is his monthly pension.\r\n\r\nBakar requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Bakar has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and restart-up credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nBakar will purchase grocery stock to open a grocery shop with his credit.

He sells shoes in his rented stall in Yerevan\u2019s clothes market.\r\n\r\nVladimir has a large number of orders for women's shoes and for this he needs a loan of 1,100,000 Armenian dram (AMD) to buy colored leather and other raw materials to produce his summer season women shoes collection. He hopes to make the order in time with Kiva lenders' help.

She hopes to grow her rice on time and make a good yield and high income.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":975,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":844.25,"image":{"id":1343859,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to plow her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Thmor Koul district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-05-04T23:40:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-03T23:40:01Z","loan_amount":975,"lender_count":27,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Bunsat","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Ang","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Chandan","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-05T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":3800000,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":975,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":127200},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":127200},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":127200},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":127200},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":127200},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":1727200},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":127200},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":127200},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":127200},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":127200},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":928000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.64},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.63},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.64},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.64},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.63},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":443.17},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.63},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.64},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":32.64},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":32.63},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":238.11}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":32.64,"local_amount":127200,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T12:53:13Z","rounded_local_amount":130253.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":373047585,"comment":null},{"amount":32.63,"local_amount":127200,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T12:06:32Z","rounded_local_amount":130253.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381838695,"comment":null},{"amount":32.64,"local_amount":127200,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T14:17:03Z","rounded_local_amount":130253.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390696835,"comment":null},{"amount":32.64,"local_amount":127200,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T19:01:34Z","rounded_local_amount":130253.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399943035,"comment":null},{"amount":32.63,"local_amount":127200,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T20:23:38Z","rounded_local_amount":130253.6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410226182,"comment":null},{"amount":648.43,"local_amount":2527200,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-19T10:44:11Z","rounded_local_amount":2587868.56,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":420333091,"comment":null},{"amount":32.64,"local_amount":127200,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-18T00:00:10Z","rounded_local_amount":130253.59,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429642241,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-08T19:47:33Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":555420,"name":"Burenbuyn","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Mrs. Burenbuyn, 35 years old, lives with her husband and son in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia.

During the harsh wintertime, they burn tons of coal in order to heat their Mongolian traditional ger. \r\n\r\nSo, Burenbuyn is requesting a loan of 2,000,000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials, such as bricks, planks, cement, fiberglass and foam. Using these building materials, she and her husband can finish their house and after that, insulate their house with fiberglass. The resulting high-quality house will enable the family to burn less coal, release less smoke and then contribute to the efforts against air pollution. \r\n\r\nThe borrower is a very hardworking individual who doesn't want her husband or son to chill down to their cores during the harsh wintertime.\r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":1425,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":373.76,"image":{"id":1343858,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Personal Housing Expenses","sector":"Housing","use":"to purchase building and insulation materials.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"MN","country":"Mongolia","town":"Ulaanbaatar","geo":{"level":"town","pairs":"47.916667 106.916667","type":"point"}},"partner_id":42,"posted_date":"2013-05-04T23:50:01Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-03T23:50:01Z","loan_amount":1425,"lender_count":52,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":22.71,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Burenbuyn","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-24T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"MNT","disbursal_amount":2000000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":21,"loan_amount":1425,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-06-07T07:00:00Z","amount":68666.67},{"due_date":"2013-07-08T07:00:00Z","amount":92107.22},{"due_date":"2013-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":96019.35},{"due_date":"2013-09-09T07:00:00Z","amount":94061.81},{"due_date":"2013-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":103519.95},{"due_date":"2013-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":102071.35},{"due_date":"2013-12-09T08:00:00Z","amount":103505.24},{"due_date":"2014-01-07T08:00:00Z","amount":109615.5},{"due_date":"2014-02-07T08:00:00Z","amount":110213.82},{"due_date":"2014-03-07T08:00:00Z","amount":115861.55},{"due_date":"2014-04-07T07:00:00Z","amount":116054.1},{"due_date":"2014-05-07T07:00:00Z","amount":119792.41},{"due_date":"2014-06-09T07:00:00Z","amount":120865.95},{"due_date":"2014-07-07T07:00:00Z","amount":126888.28},{"due_date":"2014-08-07T07:00:00Z","amount":128547.12},{"due_date":"2014-09-08T07:00:00Z","amount":131541.08},{"due_date":"2014-10-07T07:00:00Z","amount":135700.5},{"due_date":"2014-11-07T08:00:00Z","amount":124968.1}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.93},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":65.62},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":68.42},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":67.01},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.76},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":72.73},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":73.75},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":78.1},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":78.52},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.56},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":82.68},{"due_date":"2014-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":85.36},{"due_date":"2014-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":86.11},{"due_date":"2014-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":90.41},{"due_date":"2014-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":91.59},{"due_date":"2014-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":93.72},{"due_date":"2014-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":96.69},{"due_date":"2015-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":89.04}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":48.93,"local_amount":68666.67,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-17T09:55:32Z","rounded_local_amount":69105.57,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381690564,"comment":null},{"amount":65.04,"local_amount":92107.22,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T10:52:34Z","rounded_local_amount":92695.94,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0.58,"payment_id":390553338,"comment":null},{"amount":62.46,"local_amount":96019.35,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T11:38:08Z","rounded_local_amount":96633.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.96,"payment_id":399802352,"comment":null},{"amount":62.93,"local_amount":94061.81,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T12:13:52Z","rounded_local_amount":94663.02,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":4.08,"payment_id":410078373,"comment":null},{"amount":66.73,"local_amount":103519.95,"processed_date":"2013-10-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-11-17T14:01:59Z","rounded_local_amount":104181.62,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":7.03,"payment_id":419844813,"comment":null},{"amount":67.67,"local_amount":102071.35,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T14:44:30Z","rounded_local_amount":102723.76,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":5.06,"payment_id":429493725,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-08T23:54:56Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":1,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":555422,"name":"Nan's Group","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Age 32 and a farmer from Kampong Cham province, Nan is 32 years old and has three dependent schoolchildren.

She and her husband are able to earn about 28,000 KHR per day, to meet the family\u2019s needs.\r\n \r\nDalin has been with VisionFund for six loan cycles, and she has completely paid back the past loans. She has successfully used the past loans to better support her family and her children\u2019s education. Now, she is leading her group of four to ask for a new loan. As the leader, she is going to use her portion to buy piglets for raising, to earn additional income for her family. She hopes this loan will let her fatten her pigs, so as to make a better living and keep her children in school.

She hopes this loan will enable her to get a high yield from her rice paddy so as to better her family\u2019s living condition.  \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":150,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":0,"image":{"id":1343983,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Farming","sector":"Agriculture","use":"to buy pesticides for her farmland.","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"KH","country":"Cambodia","town":"Battambang province, Thmor Koul district","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"13 105","type":"point"}},"partner_id":204,"posted_date":"2013-05-05T13:20:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-04T13:20:03Z","loan_amount":150,"lender_count":6,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Hoert","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true},{"first_name":"Sreyya","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-04T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"KHR","disbursal_amount":500000,"repayment_interval":"At end of term","repayment_term":13,"loan_amount":150,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-16T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-14T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-13T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":500000}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":150}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[],"funded_date":"2013-05-05T18:27:36Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":554758,"name":"Sara Yaneth","description":{"languages":["es","en"],"texts":{"es":"Sara de cuarenta y tres a\u00f1os de edad vive junto a su madre y hermanos, ella posee una tienda desde hace 3 a\u00f1os donde vende productos de primera necesidad como frijol, ma\u00edz, embutidos, panes, bebidas , golosinas, entre otros, su negocio lo tiene ubicado en su lugar de residencia por los a\u00f1os que tiene de ternerla se ha hecho de mucha experiencia en las ventas que le permite alcanzar muy buenas ganancias, tiene mucha clientela pues la prefieren porque todo lo que vende es de primera calidad, a precios accesibles y sobre todo con un excelente servicio; Sara quiere realizar una nueva inversi\u00f3n pero no posee de suficiente capital por eso le solicita un cr\u00e9dito que le permita comprar granos b\u00e1sicos, pan, embutidos, producto instant\u00e1neo, golosinas, bebidas, etc. es muy responsable, asegura que podr\u00e1 saldar la deuda y a la vez tiene fe que le dar\u00e1 a su familia una mejor calidad de vida.","en":"Sara is 43 years old and lives with her mother and siblings.

Tsengelmaa, 48 years old, lives with her husband in Ulaanbaatar, the capital city of Mongolia. The family lives in their own house on a plot of land. She has been teaching kindergarten since 2002 and, during her free time, she also washes clothes and linens. Her husband has been rendering transportation services to local people, using his own truck. Their children all live on their own and sometimes gives them cash or foodstuffs to help them. The house they live in was built last year, but the walls and roof of house are vulnerable to strong winds and storms and, in the harsh wintertime, the family chills to their cores. So she is applying for a loan of 5,000,000 MNT to buy building and insulation materials, such as cement, paint, fiberglass, foam and cotton. Using those materials, she and her husband will insulate their house, and this will make their home a more comfortable, warmer, place. The renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke, and thus contribute to the efforts against air pollution. The borrower is very hard-working individual who strives for better

In order to generate more income he is planning to start up his own business selling milk and milk product to dairy farms in his region.\r\n\r\nThe loan of 500 Euro that Muharrem is requesting from KosInvest is to buy a cow and a calf. His goal is to expand his business, and this will happen soon, Muharrem says. He is very gratefully for this opportunity! \r\n"}},"status":"in_repayment","funded_amount":675,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":436.05,"image":{"id":1342922,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Livestock","sector":"Agriculture","use":"To buy a cow and a calf","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"XK","country":"Kosovo","town":null,"geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"42.583333 21","type":"point"}},"partner_id":240,"posted_date":"2013-05-05T15:10:03Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-04T15:10:03Z","loan_amount":675,"lender_count":15,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Muharrem","last_name":"","gender":"M","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-26T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"EUR","disbursal_amount":500,"repayment_interval":"Monthly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":675,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-12T07:00:00Z","amount":36},{"due_date":"2013-06-12T07:00:00Z","amount":37},{"due_date":"2013-07-12T07:00:00Z","amount":38},{"due_date":"2013-08-12T07:00:00Z","amount":39},{"due_date":"2013-09-12T07:00:00Z","amount":40},{"due_date":"2013-10-12T07:00:00Z","amount":41},{"due_date":"2013-11-12T08:00:00Z","amount":42},{"due_date":"2013-12-12T08:00:00Z","amount":43},{"due_date":"2014-01-12T08:00:00Z","amount":44},{"due_date":"2014-02-12T08:00:00Z","amount":45},{"due_date":"2014-03-12T07:00:00Z","amount":46},{"due_date":"2014-04-12T07:00:00Z","amount":49}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":48.6},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":49.95},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":51.3},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":52.65},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":54},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":55.35},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":56.7},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":58.05},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":59.4},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":60.75},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":62.1},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":66.15}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"shared","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":0.1}},"payments":[{"amount":102.6,"local_amount":76,"processed_date":"2013-05-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-06-17T11:02:55Z","rounded_local_amount":77.86,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":372964597,"comment":null},{"amount":106.65,"local_amount":79,"processed_date":"2013-07-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-08-17T12:04:53Z","rounded_local_amount":80.93,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":390609404,"comment":null},{"amount":55.35,"local_amount":41,"processed_date":"2013-08-31T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-09-17T14:23:55Z","rounded_local_amount":42,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":399853335,"comment":null},{"amount":56.7,"local_amount":42,"processed_date":"2013-09-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-10-17T15:35:39Z","rounded_local_amount":43.03,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":410128728,"comment":null},{"amount":114.75,"local_amount":85,"processed_date":"2013-11-30T08:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-12-17T18:41:55Z","rounded_local_amount":87.08,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":429543732,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-05T21:38:41Z","paid_date":null,"journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":555544,"name":"Suzana","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"Suzana, 44, is married.

His loan request was rejected all the time because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nThe family has a shoe business with a workshop in their house.

He has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The Start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people who do not have access to credit products. These rural poor people are regarded as \u201chigh risk borrowers\u201d because of their low income. \r\n\r\nWith his credit Nugzar will install gas equipment in his car.

The cell phone companies sell their cards and credit to individuals who then sell them to the public. Olivia's business strategy is to sell individual items as well as to sell credit in bulk.

Her husband has been running a taxi service for local people for four consecutive years and accumulated a vast amount of experience in picking up customers and driving them quickly to their destinations. \r\n\r\nThe house they live in has deteriorated over the years due to harsh winters, especially the bombardments of strong storms and freezing frosts. Therefore, Bolormaa is requesting a loan of 6950000 MNT to purchase building and insulation materials such as planks, cement, fiberglass, and foam. Using these materials, they can repair and insulate their house, thus providing comfortable and warm accommodations for the family. More importantly, the renovated house will enable the family to burn less coal, emit less smoke, and thus contribute to the efforts against air pollution.

But when he got a family and children, this type of work became very difficult for him, as the work was a physical exertion for him. \r\n\r\nAfter some time, Egam and his wife started their own business, which does not require hard physical work and brings a good and stable income. To this day Egam works with fattening cattle. He has a small plot of land next to his home. Currently Egam has four sheep and goats. He not only raises and sells livestock, but also sells milk from it. Every morning his wife and children sell 10 liters of milk to the neighbors and other customers. \r\n\r\nEgam's eldest son is in Russia as a migrant worker and every month, when possible, he sends financial support to his parents. Egam wants his children to have a good income and not be in need of anything. He would like to expand his business, in order to receive a larger income. Therefore he would like to get a loan from Arvand, to increase the number of livestock and the size of his income.

As a source of income for his family, Usenbai works with livestock breeding and field crop cultivation, after having started this business with 15,000 som (KGS).

She began this business on her own initiative with little capital, and she currently wishes to expand it.\r\n\r\nThe loan that she will take out is for a capital increase for fruit purchase. She will acquire the fruit in the fairs in the city of El Alto and will subsequently sell it in her retail space.

","en":"Holniso is a joyful, optimistic woman, and a caring wife and mother to two children. She stood out from her peers even in school for her enterprising nature and drive to achieve her goals. After finishing high school she was unable to enroll in a university because her parents decided to marry her off. At first Holniso lived off of her husband, but when children came her husband's income became insufficient for the family. She decided to start her own business, by renting a store in the center of the clothing market and importing women's clothing to sell. Today, 13 years later, she is still in the business. She has won many loyal customers who consider her an organized and responsible woman. The business has earned her a good income, which she spends on her children's education. Her husband works as a laborer in Russia and sends money home each month. Now Holniso wants to make a large purchase of summer clothing to match the season and improve her sales. To do that, Holniso came to Arvand for a loan to buy summer clothing for future sale. She thanks you for your support in advance. \r\n\r\n"}},"status":"paid","funded_amount":1900,"basket_amount":null,"paid_amount":1900,"image":{"id":1340972,"template_id":1},"video":null,"activity":"Clothing Sales","sector":"Clothing","use":"to buy summer season women's clothing","delinquent":null,"location":{"country_code":"TJ","country":"Tajikistan","town":"Spitamen","geo":{"level":"country","pairs":"39 71","type":"point"}},"partner_id":215,"posted_date":"2013-05-06T03:40:02Z","planned_expiration_date":"2013-06-05T03:40:02Z","loan_amount":1900,"lender_count":63,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":null,"bonus_credit_eligibility":true,"borrowers":[{"first_name":"Holniso","last_name":"","gender":"F","pictured":true}],"terms":{"disbursal_date":"2013-04-18T07:00:00Z","disbursal_currency":"TJS","disbursal_amount":9000,"repayment_interval":"Irregularly","repayment_term":14,"loan_amount":1900,"local_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-05-02T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-06-02T07:00:00Z","amount":699.45},{"due_date":"2013-07-02T07:00:00Z","amount":721.06},{"due_date":"2013-08-02T07:00:00Z","amount":743.34},{"due_date":"2013-09-02T07:00:00Z","amount":766.31},{"due_date":"2013-10-02T07:00:00Z","amount":789.99},{"due_date":"2013-11-02T07:00:00Z","amount":814.4},{"due_date":"2013-12-02T08:00:00Z","amount":839.57},{"due_date":"2014-01-02T08:00:00Z","amount":865.51},{"due_date":"2014-02-02T08:00:00Z","amount":892.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-02T08:00:00Z","amount":919.83},{"due_date":"2014-04-02T07:00:00Z","amount":948.29}],"scheduled_payments":[{"due_date":"2013-07-01T07:00:00Z","amount":0},{"due_date":"2013-08-01T07:00:00Z","amount":147.66},{"due_date":"2013-09-01T07:00:00Z","amount":152.23},{"due_date":"2013-10-01T07:00:00Z","amount":156.92},{"due_date":"2013-11-01T07:00:00Z","amount":161.78},{"due_date":"2013-12-01T08:00:00Z","amount":166.78},{"due_date":"2014-01-01T08:00:00Z","amount":171.92},{"due_date":"2014-02-01T08:00:00Z","amount":177.25},{"due_date":"2014-03-01T08:00:00Z","amount":182.72},{"due_date":"2014-04-01T07:00:00Z","amount":188.36},{"due_date":"2014-05-01T07:00:00Z","amount":194.19},{"due_date":"2014-06-01T07:00:00Z","amount":200.19}],"loss_liability":{"nonpayment":"lender","currency_exchange":"partner","currency_exchange_coverage_rate":null}},"payments":[{"amount":1900,"local_amount":9000,"processed_date":"2013-06-30T07:00:00Z","settlement_date":"2013-07-21T08:38:35Z","rounded_local_amount":9038.48,"currency_exchange_loss_amount":0,"payment_id":381752021,"comment":null}],"funded_date":"2013-05-20T01:25:03Z","paid_date":"2013-07-21T08:38:35Z","journal_totals":{"entries":0,"bulkEntries":0}},{"id":555693,"name":"David","description":{"languages":["en"],"texts":{"en":"David is a 28-year-old married man.

The loan will help these small businesses, including Amalia's. This is her first experience with Pro Mujer, joining after one of the institution's promoters invited her after visiting her home. Amalia currently has a business selling cosmetics, which she started on her own after learning the trade from her friend.

is 46 years old. She lives in Kutaisi district, West Georgia with her 49 year old husband, 20 year old son and daughter in-law.  Nana requested a loan from local financial institutions several times for a family business start-up, without any success. Her loan request was rejected every time, because of low income and the family\u2019s poor living conditions. \r\n\r\nNana\u2019s husband is an artisan. He works on house renovations for private orders and earns a small monthly income. This is the only source of living for the family, which is rarely enough to cover their monthly expenses. \r\n\r\nNana requested a loan from Credo to start-up a family business. Nana has now been approved for a loan within the framework of the new joint initiative of Kiva and Credo. The start-up loan program envisages provision of business start-up and re-startup credits with soft conditions to rural poor people, who do not have access to credit products.
